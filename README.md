# Accounting for Time Series Errors in Partially Linear Model With Single- or Multiple-Runs

============== README Description for MATLAB Code =============================

This README describes the procedure for producing the numerical results presented in the paper:

Zhang, C.M., Han, Y., and Jia, S.J. (2016). Accounting for time series errors in partially linear model with single- or multiple-runs. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 25(1):123-143. [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00401706.2016.1142904](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2014.966107)]

MATLAB codes for the numerical results are available for download from the "Supplemental Material" on the journal's website: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2014.966107.
